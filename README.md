# SwerveIO
Pronounced "Swerve - ee - oh" (rhymes with oreo), **SwerveIO** is another swerve drive library written in Java by Team 6090, just to see if we could.

## Features
- **Extendable**: A collection of interfaces allow the use of any motor controllers and encoders, with the option to use a combination of motor controllers and encoders.
- **Sensible Defaults**: SwerveIO provides built-in swerve module implementations for popular configurations, including REVRobotics Spark Max, and CTRE Talon motor controllers.
- **Java**: Written in Java by Java developers, SwerveIO takes advantage of the Java language and follows all the conventions of Java libraries.
- **Open**: All the methods used in this library are open and can be used independently if desired.
